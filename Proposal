User Stories
- Users can register to become members of the website in order to add resources and sign up for alerts 
- Logged in users can add resources by selecting a type they would like to add from consumable, health, shelter, and fill in relevant details.
- Users can filter resource tables by unique attributes e.g by expiration for consumables, cost for health services.
- Resources can be sorted by date added, expiration date, cost
- Users can view the details of a resource and resources associated with the requested resource if applicable such as services associated to a healthcare resource.
-Using a map API like MapQuest/Google Maps, user's can click a city on a map and resource tables will be filtered by city/various granularity.
 -Using a phone service API like Twilio, can provide alerts to users in a given area for new local infections/resources using an admin dashboard
- Added resources would be validated based on the category they are added to e.g consumables are not expired, shelter has positive vacancy updates
- Users can display statistics based on infections in their area including count, and infection rate compared to city population.



Data Model Additions
User table with location,contact
Generic resource table with description
Consumable resource table with qty,expiration that references generic
shelter resource table with available occupancy, cost, address
testing/health resource table with avg cost, specialty services
All specific resources such as consumables, shelter, healthcare etc. would follow a non-overlapping one-to-one Is-A relation with the generic resource table. 
Some resources may have many to one relationships e.g health resources may have referencing services 
Services would contain est. cost/wait time/description 

Minimum Viable Project
All resource collection functions including assisted filtering using map API without phone alerts.
